A collection of PowerShell scripts to streamline common tasks during the development of projects written in Python or using tools written in Python ([pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), [Bump My Version](https://callowayproject.github.io/bump-my-version/), [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), â€¦). Requires [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

## Usage

* Clone this project and copy the [`scripts`](scripts) subfolder into your project.
* Customize the scripts as needed.
* Create or edit the [`pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) of your project:
    * Use the [`requires-python`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#python-requires) entry to specify the Python version you want to use.
    * List the dependencies of the tools you use in the `dev` [dependency group](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-groups/).
    * If your project does **not** include a Python package, do not define the [`[build-system]`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#declaring-the-build-backend) table.
* Profit.

## Scripts

* [`Bootstrap.ps1`](scripts/Bootstrap.ps1) Bootstrap a development environment.
* [`New-PythonVenv.ps1`](scripts/New-PythonVenv.ps1) Create or refresh a Python virtual environment.
* [`Install-PreCommitHooks.ps1`](scripts/Install-PreCommitHooks.ps1) Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.
* [`Build-Package.ps1`](scripts/Build-Package.ps1) Build source distribution and wheel, then expand them for inspection.
* [`Release-Project.ps1`](scripts/Release-Project.ps1) Bump the project version, tag a release and push to `origin`.
* [`Set-VenvOutsideProject.ps1`](scripts/Set-VenvOutsideProject.ps1) Tell [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) to store the Python virtual environment outside the project folder. Useful to avoid [problems](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7906) with Microsoft OneDrive.

## Documentation

Use `Get-Help` to show the documentation of each script:

```powershell
PS> Get-Help .\scripts\Release-Project.ps1 -Detailed
```
